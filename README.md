# Algorithm Practice Repository

Welcome to our algorithm practice repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing algorithms using C++ and collaborating with our study group friends.

## How to Contribute

### Submitting an Algorithm
- Each week, every member of the study group should submit at least one algorithm implementation in C++.
- Create a new folder for your algorithm inside the `algorithms` directory. The name of the folder should be the name of the algorithm.
- Inside the folder, include:
  - The C++ source code file(s) implementing the algorithm.
  - A `README.md` file explaining the algorithm, its implementation, time complexity, and any other relevant details.
- Commit your changes and push them to the main branch of this repository.

### Collaborating
- Feel free to review and discuss each other's implementations through GitHub issues or pull requests.
- Provide constructive feedback to help improve each other's code and understanding of algorithms.
- Collaborate on solving algorithmic problems together by creating branches, working on them, and then merging them into the main branch.

## Guidelines
- Follow consistent naming conventions for folders, files, and variables.
- Write clear and concise code comments to explain your thought process and any tricky parts of the algorithm.
- Test your algorithm with various inputs to ensure correctness and efficiency.
- Use this repository as a learning opportunity to improve your understanding of algorithms and C++ programming.

Happy coding!
